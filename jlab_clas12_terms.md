- **Drift Chambers** System that measures the *momentum of charged particles* emerging from the target. Consists of regions containing two superlayers each. Each superlayer contains 6 layers, each one containing 112 wires.
- **Central Time-Of-Flight** (CTOF) Identifies particles given at least a 60ps timing resolution.
- **High Threshold Cherenkov Counter** (HTCC) One of the detector systems of the CLAS12 spectrometer. Used to generate a fast trigger signal in experiments with an electron beam.
- **Solenoid** Self-shielded super-conducting magnet around the beam line to produce a field primary in the beam direction.
	- Provide magnetic field for tracking central particles 
	- Moeller electron shield.
	- Uniform field for polarized target operation
- **Silicon Vertex Tracker** (SVT) part of the central detector and will be used to measure the momentum and determine the vertex of charged particles emerging from the target. It includes four regions with 10, 14, 18, and 24 sectors of double-sided modules.
- **Beamline** Comprises several subsystems for the continuous operation, control, and diagnostic of the electron flow from the accelerator through the fixed target to the dump.
- **Forward Time-Of-Flight** (FTOF) part of the forward detector used to measure the time-of-flight of charged particles emerging from the target.
- **Torus Magnet** based on six superconducting coils around the beam line to produce a field primary in the azimuthal direction.
- **Low Threshold Cherenkov Counter** (LTCC) part of the CLAS12 forward detector and used to discriminate pions from kaons. Consists of six sectors of lightweight mirrors, light collecting cones, 5-inch PMTs, and magnetic shields.
- **Electronic Calorimeters** (PCAL/EC) includes existing electromagnetic calorimeters of the CLAS sector (EC) and a pre-shower calorimeter (PCAL) installed infront of it. Calorimeters in CLAS12 will be primarily used for identification of electrons, photons, and neutrons. The PCAL and EC are sampling calorimeters and consist of six modules. Each has a triangular shape.
